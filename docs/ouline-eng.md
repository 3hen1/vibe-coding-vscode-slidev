#### **Part 4: Putting It All Together - A Complete Feature Development Workflow (Workflow)**

*   **Slide 12: Case Study: From Zero to One, Developing a "To-Do" Service**
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate an end-to-end workflow that mirrors real project requirements, using Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.

*   **Slide 13: Step 1: Project Initialization & Structure Planning**
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  In the terminal (`Ctrl+` \`), use Spring Initializr: `curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2 -d type=gradle-project -d javaVersion=21 -d bootVersion=3.2.0 -d groupId=com.example -d artifactId=todo-service -o todo-service.zip && unzip todo-service.zip`
        2.  Open **Copilot Chat** and ask: "Please plan a Spring Boot 3 project structure for me, including RESTful API and gRPC interfaces, using Java 21 features. It should include entity, service, controller, and configuration classes."
        3.  Based on the suggestions, create the package structure: `entity`, `service`, `controller`, `config`, `grpc`, etc.

*   **Slide 14: Step 2: Writing Core Logic (Using "Add To-Do Item" as an example)**
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  In `TodoEntity.java`, write the comment: `// JPA entity class: To-Do Item`.
        2.  **Copilot autocompletes** the entity class definition, including `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue` annotations.
        3.  In `TodoService.java`, write the comment: `// Service layer: Handle to-do item business logic`, and let Copilot generate the service methods.
        4.  In `TodoController.java`, use **Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`)** to add the RESTful API: "Please create REST endpoints for CRUD operations, using Spring Boot 3 best practices and Java 21 features."
        5.  Create a `todo.proto` file and write the comment: `// gRPC service definition: To-Do service`, and let **Copilot complete** the Protocol Buffers definition.
        6.  Implement the gRPC server-side logic in `TodoGrpcService.java`.

*   **Slide 15: Step 3: Debugging & Testing**
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  **VS Code Debugger:** Set a breakpoint in the `TodoService.createTodo()` method, start debugging, and inspect the object's state.
        2.  **Copilot Chat:** Select the `TodoController` class and use the `/tests` command to generate unit and integration test frameworks:
            ```java
            // Generate @WebMvcTest test class
            // Generate @SpringBootTest integration test
            // Generate gRPC client test
            ```
        3.  Use **Inline Chat** to add more test cases: "Please add tests for boundary conditions and exception handling."
        4.  Run the tests in the terminal: `./gradlew test`.

*   **Slide 16: Step 4: Code Commit**
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  Open the **VS Code Source Control** view to see the changes.
        2.  Stage the files, being careful to exclude the `build/` directory and IDE configuration files.
        3.  **Pro Tip:** In the commit message input box, click the **✨ (Sparkle) icon** to have Copilot automatically generate a conventional commit message based on your code changes:
            ```
            feat: implement todo service with REST and gRPC APIs
            
            - Add TodoEntity with JPA annotations
            - Implement TodoService with CRUD operations  
            - Create RESTful endpoints in TodoController
            - Add gRPC service definition and implementation
            - Include comprehensive unit and integration tests
            ```
        4.  Commit and push to the remote repository.

*   **Slide 17: Extended Demo: Java 21 Features & Modern Development**
    *   **Actions:**
        1.  **Copilot Chat:** Ask: "How can I use Java 21's Records, Pattern Matching, and Virtual Threads in this project?"
        2.  Refactor the code to use Records as DTOs:
            ```java
            // Let Copilot generate modern Java 21 code
            public record TodoRequest(String title, String description, boolean completed) {}
            ```
        3.  Use **Inline Chat** to add Virtual Threads support: "Please configure Spring Boot 3 to use Virtual Threads."
        4.  Demonstrate how **Copilot** helps refactor traditional code into modern Java 21 syntax.

#### **Part 5: Advanced – Best Practices & Cautions (Principles)**

*   **Slide 17: Becoming an Excellent "AI Conductor"**
    *   **The Art of Prompting:**
        *   **Be clear and specific:** "Write a function" vs. "Write an asynchronous JavaScript function that uses axios to fetch data from a URL and process the JSON response."
        *   **Provide context:** Share relevant code or data structures before asking your question.
        *   **Iterate and refine:** If the first result isn't ideal, try rephrasing or adding more details.

*   **Slide 18: You're Still the Captain – Critical Thinking**
    *   **AI is an assistant, not a god:** Copilot can make mistakes! Its code may have bugs, performance issues, or security flaws.
    *   **Golden rule: Never commit code you don't understand!**
    *   **Your responsibility:** Review, understand, test, and ultimately own your code.

*   **Slide 19: Security & Privacy Red Lines**
    *   **Never include sensitive information in code:** Don't hardcode API keys, passwords, or personal data in comments or code.
    *   **Be mindful of code origins:** Copilot is trained on public codebases—check if generated code has inappropriate licenses.
    *   **Team policies:** Discuss and establish guidelines for AI-assisted programming within your team.
