#### **Part 3: Core Skills - GitHub Copilot in Action (Hands-on)**

*   **Slide 7: Skill 1: Code Completion - Your Coding Co-pilot**
    *   **Core Usage:**
        *   **Comment-driven Development:** Write a comment like `// Create a function that takes a user ID and fetches user info from an API`, and Copilot will automatically generate the entire function.
        *   **Context-aware Completion:** After you define a data structure or function, Copilot intelligently completes subsequent code based on the context.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **You are the Captain, AI is the Co-pilot:** Always review, understand, and test the code generated by Copilot. Don't accept it blindly.
        *   **Use Shortcuts:** `Tab` (accept), `Alt+]` / `Alt+[` (cycle suggestions), `Esc` (dismiss).
    *   **Official Resources:**
        *   [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/)

*   **Slide 8: Skill 2: Agent Mode - Your All-in-One AI Advisor**
    *   **Core Usage:**
        *   **How to open:** `Ctrl+Shift+I` or click the Copilot icon in the sidebar.
        *   **Slash Commands:**
            *   `/explain`: Quickly understand legacy code.
            *   `/tests`: Generate unit tests for selected code.
            *   `/new`: Quickly scaffold a new project (e.g., `/new express.js project`).
            *   `/fix`: Automatically fix errors in the code.
        *   **Free-form Chat:** Ask questions like an expert, e.g., "How to make parallel requests in Python with aiohttp?"
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Provide Clear Context:** Use `@workspace` or `@file` to focus Copilot's attention when asking questions.
        *   **Follow-up and Iterate:** If the initial answer isn't perfect, ask follow-up questions to guide Copilot to a more precise answer.
    *   **Official Resources:**

*   **Slide 9: Skill 3: Inline Edit Mode - Immersive Code Modification**
    *   **Core Usage:**
        *   **How to open:** Press `Ctrl+I` in your code to start an inline chat.
        *   **Common Scenarios:**
            *   "Change this for loop to a map expression."
            *   "Add type hints and JSDoc comments to this function."
            *   "Extract these hardcoded strings into constants."
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Focused, Minor Refactoring:** Best for small-scale modifications and refactoring without leaving the code editor, keeping your flow uninterrupted.
        *   **Combine with Selection:** Select the code block to be modified first, then press `Ctrl+I` to make Copilot's intent clearer.
    *   **Official Resources:**
        *   [Using inline chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide#using-inline-chat)

*   **Slide 10: Skill 4: Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Connecting Code with External Tools**
    *   **Core Concept:**
        *   MCP is a protocol that allows Copilot to connect and "talk" to tools other than code, such as your browser or database client. This extends Copilot's capabilities beyond mere text generation.
    *   **Core Usage (Browser Example):**
        *   **Debug UI:** In Copilot Chat, ask "@browser what are the console errors on the current page?"
        *   **Get Page Info:** "@browser get me the HTML for the selected element."
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **A Boon for Frontend Development:** Greatly simplifies the frontend debugging process, eliminating the need to switch frequently between the IDE and browser developer tools.
        *   **Exploratory Feature:** This is a cutting-edge feature; you are encouraged to try different `@browser` commands to explore its capabilities.
    *   **Official Resources:**
        *   (As this is a cutting-edge feature, please follow the official GitHub Copilot blog and release notes for the latest information)

*   **Slide 11: Skill 5: Smart Review & Docs**
    *   **Core Usage (Review):**
        *   **Pull Request Summaries:** On a GitHub PR page, Copilot can automatically generate a summary of changes to help reviewers quickly understand the PR's purpose. (This feature may require Copilot Enterprise).
        *   **Code Review Suggestions:** In the IDE chat window, paste code and ask, "Help me review this code for potential bugs, performance issues, and best practices."
    *   **Core Usage (Docs/Comments):**
        *   **One-click Doc Generation:** Select a function or class, click the "lightbulb" icon that appears, and choose "Generate Docs".
        *   **Inline Chat for Comments:** Use `Ctrl+I` and type "Add JSDoc comments to this function".
    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **AI Review as a First Pass:** Before committing code or creating a PR, let Copilot do an initial review to catch and fix some basic errors early.
        *   **Keep Docs in Sync with Code:** Make it a habit to generate documentation for public functions and complex logic as you go.

#### **Part 4: Putting It All Together – A Complete Feature Development Workflow (Workflow)**

*   **Slide 11: Case Study – Building a "To-Do List" API from Scratch**
    *   **Goal:** Demonstrate an end-to-end workflow based on real project needs.

*   **Slide 12: Step 1 – Project Initialization & Structure Planning**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  In the terminal (`Ctrl+` \`), run `npm init -y` to initialize the project.
        2.  Open **Copilot Chat** and ask: "Please design a simple Express.js project structure with routes, controllers, and models."
        3.  Create folders and files based on the suggestions.

*   **Slide 13: Step 2 – Writing Core Logic (e.g., "Add To-Do Item")**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  In `todoController.js`, add a comment: `// Controller function: create a new to-do item`.
        2.  **Copilot autocompletes** the function skeleton.
        3.  Use **Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`)** to add input validation: "Add validation for a, b, c in the request body."
        4.  In the corresponding `todo.js` route file, use comments or partial code to guide **Copilot** in completing the Express route definition.

*   **Slide 14: Step 3 – Debugging & Testing**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **VS Code Debugger:** Set breakpoints, start debugging, inspect variables.
        2.  **Copilot Chat:** Select the `addTodo` function and use the `/tests` command to generate a unit test skeleton.
        3.  Complete test cases and run tests in the terminal.

*   **Slide 15: Step 4 – Code Commit**
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Open the **VS Code Source Control** view to review changes.
        2.  Stage files.
        3.  **Pro tip:** In the commit message box, click the **✨ (Sparkle) icon** to let Copilot generate a conventional commit message based on your code changes!
        4.  Commit and push.

#### **Part 5: Advanced – Best Practices & Cautions (Principles)**

*   **Slide 16: Becoming an Excellent "AI Conductor"**
    *   **The Art of Prompting:**
        *   **Be clear and specific:** "Write a function" vs. "Write an asynchronous JavaScript function that uses axios to fetch data from a URL and process the JSON response."
        *   **Provide context:** Share relevant code or data structures before asking your question.
        *   **Iterate and refine:** If the first result isn't ideal, try rephrasing or adding more details.

*   **Slide 17: You're Still the Captain – Critical Thinking**
    *   **AI is an assistant, not a god:** Copilot can make mistakes! Its code may have bugs, performance issues, or security flaws.
    *   **Golden rule: Never commit code you don't understand!**
    *   **Your responsibility:** Review, understand, test, and ultimately own your code.

*   **Slide 18: Security & Privacy Red Lines**
    *   **Never include sensitive information in code:** Don't hardcode API keys, passwords, or personal data in comments or code.
    *   **Be mindful of code origins:** Copilot is trained on public codebases—check if generated code has inappropriate licenses.
    *   **Team policies:** Discuss and establish guidelines for AI-assisted programming within your team.
